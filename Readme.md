# DictString

[DictString](/DictString/) is a really small project which was startet to create a string representing a dictionary. After the first implementation I noticed that I didn't use _Stringbuilder_ wich lead into some performance issues. After realising my fail, I was curious how big the performance input was. This is the outcome.

Everyone is invited to extend this thingie. Here are some things, that came into my mind:

* Maybe I will have to search for another name
* It would be interesting to measure the breakeven point
* Measure RAM consumption (I wasn't able get it working the right way)
* ...

[Usage](/Uasge/) is really simple:

* Compile
* Start
* Throw in number of dictionary entries
* Wait
* look at the numbers wich you will find in the *.csv files of the running directory
* you are bored? analyse the *.txt files wich you will find in the running directory
